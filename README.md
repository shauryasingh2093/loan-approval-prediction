üè¶ Bank Loan Approval Prediction using PySpark
üìå Overview
This project presents a machine learning pipeline developed with PySpark to predict bank loan approvals. It leverages various classification algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees, to evaluate applicant eligibility based on historical data.

üîç Problem Statement
Financial institutions often face challenges in assessing loan applications efficiently and accurately. This project aims to automate the loan approval process by building predictive models that analyze applicant data to determine loan eligibility, thereby enhancing decision-making and reducing manual workload.

üß∞ Features and Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Imputation techniques to address null entries.

Feature Engineering: Creation of new features such as Combined Income and Income-to-Loan Ratio.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Utilizing StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder for categorical data.

Feature Scaling: Applying StandardScaler to normalize feature values.

Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.

Addressing Class Imbalance: Implementing Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset.

Results
The models were evaluated based on their performance metrics:


Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score	ROC-AUC
Decision Tree	78.38%	79.08%	78.38%	76.96%	0.73
SVM	80.00%	100.00%	44.00%	62.00%	0.78
KNN	74.32%	72.00%	98.00%	83.00%	0.66
Random Forest	81.08%	79.00%	96.00%	87.00%	0.83
The Random Forest model demonstrated the best overall performance, making it the preferred choice for deployment.
